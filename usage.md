#Api Usage#

##Authentication##

We use http authentication.
You need to put your *API KEY* as user, and the *CLIENT_ID* as password.
You get and *API KEY* when you register to the API.
You generate by your own your *CLIENT_ID*, but it needs to be unique and
consistent, and anonymous for each user. For example you can attribute an
incremental id, or an uuid.
